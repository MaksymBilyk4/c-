Different options for opening a file for writing
std::fstream optionally accepts a second argument in its constructor — file opening options. These are:

std::ios::app — go to the end of the file on each write operation;
std::ios::binary — open the file as binary;
std::ios::in — open the file for reading only;
std::ios::out — open the file for writing only;
std::ios::trunc — clear the file after opening;
std::ios::ate — go to the end of the file after opening (once).
Options can be combined using the bitwise OR (|) operator.
