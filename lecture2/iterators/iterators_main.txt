vec.end() !!! ---> will pointing to next element in memory that goes after last element of other collection
MEMORY represent:
                         |3 |5 |2 |4 |2 |other data
vec.end() pointer here ------->        ^ (next data in memory)

         reset pointer
         iterator = vec.begin();
         * - current pointer address
         ++ - go to next address
         -- - return back to previous address
         begin() - sets pointer to first element
         end() - sets pointer to last element
         front() - value of FIRST element
         back() - value of LAST element
