// The std::ranges::advance() algorithm moves the iterator passed as the first argument by the number of places specified in the second argument,
// but ensures that this advancement does not go beyond the third argument.
// Effectively, this is a safer alternative for scenarios where we are unsure whether the advancement would exceed the end of the range.
